Niklas_Maak: (00:44) good afternoon it's a great 
pleasure for me to welcome you all to this talk 
on architecture and technology it's also a great 
pleasure for me to welcome Rem Koolhaas founding 
partner of OMA curator of this biennial and Tony 
Fadell who is known as one of the so called fathers 
of the iPod for his fundamental work on Apple's 
famous music player he's also the founder and CEO 
of Nest Labs a company that among other products 
designs and manufactures sensor driven learning 
devices like thermostats as you might have heard 
Nest was recently acquired by Google and it's 
maybe the most unnecessary thing to introduce 
Rem Koolhaas here lengthly to you if you stroll 
the internet for a minute you only find superlatives 
the most influential controversial or the most 
celebrated most enigmatic most important architect 
and architectural thinker of our time so let me 
maybe first say some words about this biennial 
for all of you who just arrived and hadn't had 
the occasion already to see the exhibition it's 
a very special biennial called fundamentals and it 
differs fundamentally from previous biennials it's 
to somewhat not about architects and their current 
projects like it was often the case but it's about 
the history or to be more precise about the histories 
of universally familiar elements that every architect 
uses like the floor the door the wall the ramp and 
so on and instead of just displaying the contemporary 
production of buildings it investigates on the 
history of these fundamental elements of architecture 
and also on the history of modernization in 66 
countries which happens in the pavilions all that 
in order to create a solid base to answer the question 
what do we have in architecture and where does 
architecture go or could go from here as you all know 
OMA has since its foundation in 1975 reframed the 
practice of architecture of urban planning of cultural 
analysis in architecture and it has created 
groundbreaking buildings like the Berlin Embassy 
the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing the Casa de Musica in 
Porto or the Public Library of Seattle you know that 
building where a ramp spirals up through four storeys 
on a continuous series of shelves creating an unseen 
new social space it was basically profound research 
on elements like the ramp but preceded this building 
in Seattle and comparibly I would say this exhibition 
investigates on the history of elements to finally 
stretch out to a possible future of architecture and 
building so I would love to start with something we can 
discover in this space in the main pavilion space 
dedicated to the fireplace you find the very ancient 
fireplaces there but also a thermostat by Nest and also 
a disturbingly effective system that does not heat the 
whole room anymore but that makes the heat which required 
to follow you through that room so the heat follows you 
while you're moving through that room so Rem what was 
your interest in bringing these things together the very 
ancient and these new technologies

Rem_Koolhaas: (04:40) you said most of it but 
basically I wanted to take a moment in principle for 
myself but I thought it was interesting to share it 
with the architectural community to reflect on elements 
of architecture because I realized that I had been 
producing architecture relatively thoughtfully but that 
on certain elementary and fundamental level and that 
I would call that a level of elements I had been rather 
sketchy and that I had actually taken it for granted what 
the meaning of a floor was what the meaning of a ceiling 
was what the meaning of a wall was so it was really to 
correct my own laziness that I launched the program of 
research with Harvard University for two years and where 
we try to identify the history of every element in every 
culture so what the different meanings of particular 
elements had been over time and halfway through this 
process and that was actually kind of an improvisation 
we began to realize that almost every architectural element 
was about to associate itself with digital technology 
traditionally architectural elements are mute and deaf 
in other words they cannot speak and they cannot listen 
but that is about to change because certain elements 
are now equipped with digital devices which make them 
able to respond and make them able to listen and in the 
case of the thermostat actually it is essential that you 
talk to them and after a while a kind of relationship is 
being established between the element and the owner of 
that element so halfway through the kind of research we 
confronted the fact that it is not only the fact that 
technologies are influencing architecture which it was 
a more fundamental choice in front of us and probably 
this isn't even a choice anymore it's a given but a 
given to which we as an architectural community have not 
really given any thought I would say that from now on each 
element will be profoundly influenced by its association with 
the digital world and so in that sense it was wonderful to 
get to know Tony we had some interviews and I began to 
understand but don't fully yet the implication of elements 
like Tony's and his invention

Niklas_Maak: (07:53) so so maybe I think most of you 
and including me do not precisely understand what happens 
when we come to a house that is equipped with your devices 
so maybe you could talk about the thermostat and maybe 
some other devices that you develop

Tony_Fadell: (08:07) sure sure I'm sure this is 
probably one of the first times Silicon Valley has shown 
up at at this festival so and I'm glad to be able to 
represent but you know what we're fundamentally doing 
differently is taking the technology that we've been 
creating and that actually powers things like the 
smartphone and and products like it and embedding the 
technology inside of very important products in fact 
unloved products in the home for many years so in the 
case of a thermostat how did I get there how did I 
figure out from doing the iPod and then the iPhone to 
actually doing a thermostat and for me what it started out 
was we were designing this at the time this had not yet 
been in the market place yet and at at the same time 
as designing them

Rem_Koolhaas: (09:03) what time are you talking about

Tony_Fadell: (09:04) excuse me so this was about 2005 
2006 we were designing this working on this and I was 
beginning to design a home for our family a second home in 
Lake Tahoe California and when I had this product in my hand 
and working with it I thought to myself how will the world 
change when the when the interface to your world will 
always be in your hand how will the car change how will 
vehicle's change how will the office change and how will 
homes change when this could be one of the primary interfaces 
to your to your home so designing the house was around that 
and then also designing it around green and environmental 
decisions so going back to the elements going back to 
every single element as Rem has shown here and understanding 
what would it be when it's connected and green and creating 
a new thing and that's where we came on to the thermostat

Niklas_Maak: (10:06) so you started with the thermostat

Tony_Fadell: (10:08) yes

Niklas_Maak: (10:09) how exactly does that work so you 
talk to it it's always a little disturbing to see someone talk 
to a part of his house so what happens

Tony_Fadell: (10:17) so so the the Nest Learning Thermostat 
it's a Learning Thermostat you don't talk to it you 
literally the way you control it is like any device 
you just literally turn it up or down it's it's one big 
knob it's one big dial and you just turn it up and down 
based on your temperature preference it's that simple 
but what we found was it's not just beautiful object but 
it's a learning object and why is it learning because 
most people didn't know how to program a thermostat if you 
had a traditional thermostat or actually a thermostat 
from the 70s or 80s they haven't really changed you had to 
program in when you wanted a temperature at a certain 
time and you had to do that for each day of the week and 
then as your as your schedule changed you had to go and 
change it it was very much like a 1980s VCR where it was 
blinking at you the time right just no one did that so they 
just literally was a manual thermostat so we did instead was 
literally as you turned it up or down we said after three days 
you like at this temperature at this time this evening you 
like at this temperature at this time so why don't we just 
program it for you based on your habits and project that 
forward and then as the seasons change and you change your 
habits we just learn and adapt to that

Niklas_Maak: (11:36) so that means that the object gathers 
information and communicates also with other devices if 
I understand that rightly

Tony_Fadell: (11:45) well it can it can do that but first 
and foremost it's a device it does not have to be connected to 
anything in the Internet it can work alone standalone but 
if you do connect it there's all kinds of benefits you 
get from connecting it to our servers such as you can get 
you can control it from any smart phone in the world or 
any tablet or any computer so that you can check in not 
just control the temperature but you can check in on 
it to see how the home what temperature it is it can you can 
see what your energy history how much energy you've used 
thermostats before you just turn them on or off you had no 
idea the energy impact you had right a thermostat in the US 
and in Europe controls anywhere between 50 and 70 percent 
of your annual energy bill

Niklas_Maak: (12:31) yeah

Tony_Fadell: (12:32) your total energy bill

Niklas_Maak: (12:33) so but this thing works in a way that 
you connect several individual thermostats and you connect 
that with an energy supply plant if I understand that right

Tony_Fadell: (12:42) yeah yeah so so

Niklas_Maak: (12:43) there is it is a system of communicating 
singular cells and maybe you can talk more about this because

Tony_Fadell: (12:52) sure

Niklas_Maak: (12:53) you can't save energy only if you 
really connect all these

Tony_Fadell: (12:55) sure

Niklas_Maak: (12:56) personal

Tony_Fadell: (12:57) sure it's it's designed to be able to 
be a standalone product but then when it sees more products 
like it around they start to communicate together and what 
they do is literally they do things like understand the 
temperature in different parts of the home making sure that 
you're not cooling one part of the home and another part is 
heating so that they're fighting and wasting energy they also 
communicate to to learn when you're home and when you're away

Niklas_Maak: (13:21) which means there is an instant device 
that knows everything about your dwelling habits when you get 
up when you go to bed when you want to have a cool room when 
you want to have a heated bath so Rem are you sharing this 
euphoria for this brave new world or are you skeptical are you 
enthusiastic about this development of communicating houses

Rem_Koolhaas: (13:45) I have mixed feelings I think I admire 
the intelligence and I think that also the way in which you 
can connect it to serious issues like energy use and like 
sustainability and where you could actually use it as a kind 
of tool to be frugal and kind of responsible I think that 
could be good but I think there's also kind of fundamental 
kind of reluctance on my part to see architecture be turned 
into products to begin with to the relentless commercialization 
of architectural elements and ultimately without being 
particularly paranoid about it the degree to which you give 
away elements of yourself but that may be kind of simply 
a fundamentally different perception of the value of privacy 
between my generation and your generation where my generation 
sees privacy something that it values and it's been educated 
but also used to keep privacy to keep things to themselves 
and I think it is very clear that other generations are 
emerging for whom sharing secrets and sharing elements of 
themselves it's a form of regular human intercourse

Niklas_Maak: (15:17) yeah maybe we should take this this 
problem of privacy later on I just wanted to stick with 
one point which is I think very crucial for this discussion is 
it's basically maybe one of the first moments in the history 
of architecture where the development of new forms of 
architecture is primarily in the hands of private enterprises 
and I mean it's it's interesting that that Google was so 
interested in thermostats and when I heard this news first 
that Google bought your company for a 3.2 billion dollars 
I thought wow what do they want to do with thermostats and 
of course it's much more than that I know that

Tony_Fadell: (15:55) it's much more yes

Niklas_Maak: (15:56) it's much more than that but as it's 
much more than that it's very interesting because normally 
you know that Google is not primarily interested in the 
reduction of the carbon footprint but rather in the

Tony_Fadell: (16:05) actually

Niklas_Maak: (16:06) exploration of your digital footprint so

Tony_Fadell: (16:08) it is actually very it's it's very 
interested in reducing carbon footprint and that's one of 
the one of the reasons why they were interested in us is 
because we know that it's going to take many individuals 
working together to actually be able to bring about change 
heating and cooling residential heating and cooling in the US 
alone accounts for 10% of the entire energy consumption and 
so what can we do in each stage to to help save energy

Niklas_Maak: (16:33) yeah yeah I'm trying to escape a 
little trap that inevitably shows up when people from Silicon 
Valley meet European architects journalists and thinkers 
that is a confrontation of technophoria from

Tony_Fadell: (16:48) sure sure

Niklas_Maak: (16:49) California technophobia from Europe 
but but still I'm sometimes quite worried if I see what 
happens to to values like like informational self-determination 
so how do you deal with this issue

Tony_Fadell: (17:02) so

Niklas_Maak: (17:03) how do you how do you protect the 
use of your products from a possibility to be spied 
out which is

Tony_Fadell: (17:09) well well

Niklas_Maak: (17:10) big question

Tony_Fadell: (17:11) well first you know you are always in 
control so these products don't take control away from you all 
we're doing is we're learning from your habits so we're not 
imposing anything on anyone in fact in most cases we're 
actually just educating and giving you feedback on what your 
what your abilities are but in terms of privacy and security we 
are not a part of Google actually we might be owned by Google 
but our data and our data services are stored in a different 
location we have a separate management team a separate culture 
a separate brand for a reason we believe your data is your data 
and the data is only used for improvement of the products

Niklas_Maak: (17:49) yeah

Tony_Fadell: (17:50) it is not for putting ads on thermostats

Niklas_Maak: (17:51) yeah yeah

Tony_Fadell: (17:52) or anything like that

Niklas_Maak: (17:53) we have we have several very interesting 
topics here now one is privacy and one is that you say you 
are educating people I'm very interested in that aspect 
because normally education through architecture through built 
products was merely a stately domain the state was defining 
what's the minimum size of an apartment how much it should be 
heated how big should a kitchen be now it's private enterprises 
like like yours for defining how people should be educated but 
maybe you want to

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:22) yeah I

Niklas_Maak: (18:23) get to the

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:24) I would like to dwell on the thermostat 
a little bit longer because you said it's not going to tell 
you what to do but I saw in one application that it turns 
green if you're behaving correctly right vis a vis

Tony_Fadell: (18:37) so there is a there is a

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:38) okay and then so there is a moment 
where maybe it's not telling you what to do but it's 
indicating when you're transgressing in the light of 
human responsibility to be careful with our planet right

Tony_Fadell: (18:57) yes absolutely

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:59) so and I think you don't have to be a 
technophobe or European to consider that that has the 
potential to really I mean I made a caricature at some point 
after 10 o'clock you could have a device that tells you that 
to be responsible to mankind you should go to bed because 
otherwise you you consume energy beyond your allotted quantity 
and unless you pay of course

Tony_Fadell: (19:35) sure we could take it to that that 
conclusion if you will but at the end of the day you know 
people don't really know even today with the devices in 
their home they don't know how much energy is being 
consumed they don't understand how much heating and 
cooling does actually consume of your dollars so all we're 
doing is giving you a feedback loop to allow you to adapt 
if you so choose

Rem_Koolhaas: (19:57) there's another thing before we go 
to the said I asked you in the interview we had before 
whether this was an invention for America or for the world

Tony_Fadell: (20:08) yes

Rem_Koolhaas: (20:09) and where you were currently selling 
it and I would like you to kind of see to say something 
about the applicability of this in other cultures

Tony_Fadell: (20:16) sure sure

Rem_Koolhaas: (20:17) and in other climates and in other 
environments

Tony_Fadell: (20:19) sure so when we first

Rem_Koolhaas: (20:20) because of course as the the inventor 
of so many elements that I have been received with universal 
acceptance universal enthusiasm and have now established 
themselves as the unmissable entities do you expect the 
same thing there is same thing to happen to this kind of 
thermostat or do you think there is a difference in degree

Tony_Fadell: (20:45) well I first when we looked at and did 
our research before we started the company thermostats are a 
problem all around the world and they have very similar people 
have similar problems all around the world so we currently 
now sell the product in three countries only three countries 
US Canada and UK but we because they're connected we can actually 
see where they're being where they're being purchased in and 
installed and we're finding they're in over 90 countries where 
we don't even sell people want these devices maybe they're 
maybe they like the technology or what have you and we are 
quickly rolling this out to various various other countries but 
what we should say is we are specifically looking and going 
into homes in each country we do 200 300 different homes in 
each country we enter to learn about the behaviors inside of 
the home how the family works how you know the different the 
different ways we can adapt the technology for that home so 
we don't obviously just come and take the American imperialism 
and say you're going to have it this way it took us a year to 
adapt the product to hit the UK market one year of research 
and design

Rem_Koolhaas: (21:51) what adjustments did you make

Tony_Fadell: (21:53) so what adjustments did we make first 
of all only 40 percent of UK homes actually have a thermostat 
so if I said today we're now selling the Nest Learning 
Thermostat to the UK they would go what's a thermostat sixty 
percent of people go I don't even know what a thermostat is 
they have something called a programmer and we've had to add 
programmer functionality into the thermostat to adapt to 
the way people use those types of products in the UK we've 
also had we also know that people are energy conscious in 
different countries so it may be it's not always about energy 
savings it's about information so each country has a different 
way they think about these elements and we need to make sure 
we adapt to them and not the other way around

Niklas_Maak: (22:35) well I might maybe come back for a 
second on the quite dystopic picture that was embedded in the 
Rem's vision of the house telling you not to use that much 
energy I mean even today already cars are able to provide 
insurance companies and

Tony_Fadell: (22:52) yes

Niklas_Maak: (22:53) maybe the police and maybe private agent

Rem_Koolhaas: (22:55) Niklas is a great expert on the car

Niklas_Maak: (22:58) yeah because I think things show up 
first in cars and then in architecture and I think if you look 
closely at cars now they're already able to provide insurance 
companies

Tony_Fadell: (23:07) yes

Niklas_Maak: (23:08) and private agents agents with detailed 
data about your driving style

Tony_Fadell: (23:12) absolutely

Niklas_Maak: (23:13) your emotional state

Tony_Fadell: (23:14) yes

Niklas_Maak: (23:15) and some of the cars tell you make a 
break you're driving since six hours and so the car controls 
the the driver in a very close way so and the question is how 
this might follow in this digital path so so what do you think 
how can you prevent the machines that you're creating from 
from getting out of control in terms of that the self 
determination of the dweller is endangered

Tony_Fadell: (23:41) well I think

Rem_Koolhaas: (23:42) sorry I think I want to elaborate on the 
question I think that it's not that you want to ask Tony how he 
is going to prevent that his machines are

Niklas_Maak: (23:52) no no

Rem_Koolhaas: (23:53) going wrong but how are you going to 
avoid that others because if you look at architecture the whole 
of architecture is full of magnificent moments done with 
incredible intelligence and then disseminating and kind of 
becoming decadent being distributed across the entire world 
and turning into a kind of horrible mess our patron saint is 
Mies van der Rohe he invented the curtain wall the abstract 
tower and if you see one for real it's breathtaking but if you 
see the consequences of its invention it's really truly a nightmare 
so I think we are not only talking about you and about your 
intelligence we are talking about the direction you represent and 
the domain you represent and the way of thinking you represent 
which you may not control because all of us have the kind of 
same problem we are thinkers we have a vision but we cannot 
control with what others do with our vision

Tony_Fadell: (24:53) absolutely

Rem_Koolhaas: (24:54) or how they

Tony_Fadell: (24:55) and the Snowden the Snowden revelations 
have shown that no matter what we can do as companies and 
protect all of the data there still could be nefarious things 
going on that we are that are unbeknownst to us so I think these 
are questions that we have to continue to bring up and we have 
to have transparency so not just transparency through the products 
transparency through the companies that we work with but also 
through our governments and what we're doing and what we as as 
Google as as well as other large data store companies are asking 
the US government to be much more transparent about these things 
and make sure that we have an open dialogue and understanding 
of what's really being done and why it's being done so we are 
right now at this precipice of what is going to happen with 
these kinds of connected objects and it's going to I don't think 
it's gonna stop it's not going to be answered this year and 
it's not gonna be answered for hundreds of years it's going to 
be an ongoing dialogue

Rem_Koolhaas: (25:53) can can can I have a show of hands who 
believes in transparency Tony

Tony_Fadell: (26:06) yes I see I see

Rem_Koolhaas: (26:12) I think transparency is simply not strong 
enough as an argument to to counteract some of these questions

Tony_Fadell: (26:20) I understand

Rem_Koolhaas: (26:21) particularly if you talk about transparencies 
in government and then kind of a part one effect of whatever 
government I think we are all inert and have kind of developed 
a sincere cynicism about a possibility itself and that is exactly 
our tragedy because we would love to believe in it we would love 
to believe that transparency is achievable but at the same time 
we live in a world where exactly the digital makes everything so 
opaque and so untraceable and so beyond our reach in terms of 
following all its path that transparency is in from your mouth 
kind of really not the hatch we are looking for

Tony_Fadell: (27:12) and I understand that there are we always 
know that there's no perfection in terms of transparency so 
I have a different question how many of you have smartphones here 
in the audience can you raise your hand how many of you okay 
how many of you would give them up right now and never use them 
again because your fear of security well you got rid of it you 
don't have it anymore no more okay no my my I guess my my only 
point here is specifically look there are convenience that comes 
through connectivity there are things that can be born out of 
connectivity but we always have the downsides of technology the 
same thing goes when the first telephones were installed right 
we it's it's it's

Rem_Koolhaas: (27:53) I think it's not about whether we believe 
our iPhones or not I mean of course we believe our iPhones 
and but we all are deeply cynical about what they can really 
represent but we live with that cynicism because it gives us 
certain things we want but in the end they have the ability to 
throw it away or not and of course anything that is embedded in 
architecture as a kind of totally different status and quality 
because it is embedded

Niklas_Maak: (28:25) I would be I would be interested at that 
point to ask those to the architect about how how actually is 
architecture changing or the terms we we use to describe and 
conceive architecture how are they changing if you look at the 
technological change if we talked about this earlier on if people 
are starting to work from home from their bedroom if they're 
sitting eight hours in their bedroom sitting with a laptop 
communicating through mobile phones and Twitter you could say 
the privacy is not given anymore anyway but then what how do you 
react as an architect to these technological changes that also 
changed our idea and our conception of privacy and public life 
because you could argue that the bedroom equipped with iPhone and 
laptop is much more of a public space than other spaces in town so

Rem_Koolhaas: (29:12) I've tried to write kind of something about 
my kind of even worse feelings about this whole thing and in my 
essay I'm kind of suggesting that the values egalite fraternite 
and whatever the third one was have been have been and it's kind 
of symptomatic that I don't even know are now replaced by comfort 
security and sustainability and that that in itself is a kind 
of went in parallel with kind of shift in power kind of globally 
where in the 60s 70s we witnessed almost everywhere the state in 
its relatively vigorous form where in countries like Europe we 
even at a welfare state a state that took care of its citizens 
but where since the introduction and appearance on the scene of 
Reagan and Thatcher particularly from the anglosaxon world onward 
another logic has been preached the logic of the market that has 
systematically dismantled the state and what is the real dilemma 
for architects is that we use to work as extensions of the state 
to some extent and therefore we were always in connection to good 
intentions or we could claim that or believe it but now we are 
condemned to work for individuals and and hopefully they're the 
right transparent individuals but of course this guarantee is no 
longer there and that means that the vast thrust of our ingenuity 
is gone to satisfying individual needs and what has been kind of 
completely disappearing is our thinking about collective means 
and that is a kind of really drastic shift from which we have not 
really emerged and which we haven't even kind of articulated in 
a kind of smart way yet

Niklas_Maak: (31:37) maybe I think that's an interesting topic 
to discuss because if we talk right now about comfort and security 
and improving houses to get be more green and more energy-efficient 
than we're talking about the houses as we know them like houses 
in suburbia or apartments in the city but it's a given fact that 
if you look at demographics which is I think very important you 
see that within the next two decades up to like 700 million people 
will move to big agglomerations of Asia and India alone and they 
have to live in places and inhabitable units and these inhabitable 
units will not be houses as we know them or apartment buildings 
as we know them so my question would be if we're talking about 
architecture and technology it cannot only be the question of 
how to improve gradually the the classic single-family home but 
really to how to create and produce and build new structures that 
can cope with these incredible masses of people who have to be 
housed in the future so my question to both of you would be over 
talking about architecture and technology what is the important 
point when we're talking about these new forms of inhabitable 
units and the related questions like how will these people dwell 
what kind of social life will they lead in these agglomerations 
so what would be your ideas about this issue Tony

Tony_Fadell: (33:05) well well well right now we are we've 
already been asked to work on many of this intelligent cities 
or green cities in China and to give our ideas of what this 
could what it could look like and what we're finding is 
that collectively when individuals get information about 
their habits as well as understand how they are relative to 
those who are right around them they actually adapt very 
quickly to more than the the norm they understand when 
they're outside epsilon of of the norm and so what we find is 
individuals driven by other individuals not by governments not 
by companies but individuals driven by other individual data 
actually makes people change change dramatically in a way that's 
actually beneficial to the overall good because we're all 
concerned about the same things we're concerned about the 
environment we're concerned about costs we're concerned about 
our children and so when you actually be able to make that 
information available then people actually respond appropriately 
not more rules but just information to allow people to have make 
better decisions

Rem_Koolhaas: (34:12) I I have an observation I am driving a 
very old car and it it frequently breaks down and then I have 
obliged to rent a new car and basically there is a kind of 
particular kind of car that kind of in front of you project your 
speed and my sad conclusion is that in a car that projects my 
speed I'm driving better and kind of more obediently than in my 
car that doesn't kind of indicate my speed so it is true that 
all these devices have a kind of tendency to make us behave 
better but I think and and and almost every word you use is 
kind of about better improved correct

Tony_Fadell: (35:06) but but we

Rem_Koolhaas: (35:07) you mention it for the children younger 
generation all of that implies that if you don't behave well 
you're totally responsible nightmarish asshole who doesn't 
care about

Tony_Fadell: (35:16) no

Rem_Koolhaas: (35:17) the younger generations

Tony_Fadell: (35:19) I'm saying collectively not individually

Rem_Koolhaas: (35:20) what about no no what about transgression

Tony_Fadell: (35:23) transgression

Rem_Koolhaas: (35:24) transgression where is transgression in 
your in your story

Tony_Fadell: (35:29) yeah yeah I I well first there's two things 
one is what is what means good what means bad in other words 
who's controlling the algorithms that's saying these are the right 
algorithms I think we have to look at that and understand when we 
have artificial intelligence who's creating those things that 
are giving you the feedback is that the right feedback 
transgressions absolutely I think you know whether you're a 
teenager or you're older you should still be able to do whatever 
you so choose to do but typically people you know if they're 
individuals they want to be individuals but that's usually when 
they're they don't have a family or they don't have real connections 
to the community when they have connections to the community then 
they start thinking much more not just about themselves they think 
a little bit broader and so I totally believe people should be in 
control of their own lives the way they choose to but at the end 
of the day certain people want to see our future generations be 
better than they are today

Rem_Koolhaas: (36:23) of course of course yeah

Niklas_Maak: (36:25) but but then how do you find better better 
means more obedient or could the opposite thing be true to

Tony_Fadell: (36:32) I'm no moral judge I'm no moral judge 
I'm no moral jury all I know is when I'm spending too much money 
on my heating and I have no control over it whatsoever and I 
finally have information that's great just like if I consume too 
much food or I do something like that I want that information to 
make either myself better in some way or whatever way I want maybe 
I'm too nice maybe I'm I'm following too many of the rules I want 
to break the rules the information just tells you are relative

Rem_Koolhaas: (37:00) yeah yeah

Niklas_Maak: (37:01) could could we

Tony_Fadell: (37:02) I'm not listening to enough different music 
not just the music I always like to listen

Niklas_Maak: (37:05) could we talk about discomfort because we're 
talking a lot about comfort and security can we talk about the 
quality of discomfort I mean as this Japanese writer Junichiro 
Tanizaki who in his book In Praise of Shadows writes it's it's 
the sudden sensation of coming into the cold the attentiveness 
that you have to this effect of the cold intensifies your 
perception and makes you a lucky person so how do you deal with 
this idea of discomfort of challenging environments as a quality

Tony_Fadell: (37:35) so so so to me when I grew up the most 
memorable moments I had in my family is when there was conflict 
when there was discomfort whether it was pleasurable or a 
nonpleasurable discomfort when there was conflict of some sort 
when I look and we purchased you know like we purchased a car for 
our family we have two young three now three young children people 
were saying well why don't you get the rear cars you know the car 
TVs the TVs in the rear seats and everything cuz it pacifies the 
kids it's the best babysitter ever I'm like the memorable moments 
that I had was not having that technology there but when the kids 
are screaming at each other and doing these things so our goal at 
Nest is to actually get the technology behind the scenes not put 
yet another screen in front of your face you know my wife always 
says you know when I when she goes you know we try to get the kids 
off of these things she goes you're the guy who created it you're 
the problem here right you're the one who put these in front of 
all of our kids and I agree with that right in a way but at the 
same time these new things that we put in our homes we need to 
make sure the technology stays as part of the fixed elements it's 
not in your face not another screen to distract and bring more 
comfort but to allow more conflict

Niklas_Maak: (38:50) can can your thermostats simulate discomfort 
cold sudden cold or

Tony_Fadell: (38:56) absolutely

Niklas_Maak: (38:57) can you program them like that

Tony_Fadell: (38:58) we could absolutely do that you know people 
ask me all the time did does your does your device actually you 
know fix the the spouse problem and what's the spouse problem this 
one spouse turns it up to this temperature and the other spouse 
five minutes later turns it down to the next temperature and it 
and they fight and I said we are not a marriage counsellor Nest 
the Learning Thermostat is not a marriage counselor but what we 
do do is we can tell you who did what when and then you can have 
that that fight over what's the right thing to do for the family 
what's the right thing to do for your home so no more passive 
aggressiveness you're gonna actually be able to have data and 
go oh yes you did no I didn't yes you did

Niklas_Maak: (39:39) so so Rem how how can you escape the overly 
comfy and overly secure building as an architect

Rem_Koolhaas: (39:47) Well as an architect you have a vast 
repertoire of discomfort at your almost dangerous repertoire so 
for us that is not a problem we can create discomfort every 
Monday morning but it is true that and for instance there is a 
room in the exhibition which is dedicated to to ramp which I 
find personally one of the most fascinating rooms because that 
is developed by it's a room about two men that were born in the 
same year in 1923 who came out of the war as 22 young vigorous 
man one an American and one a Frenchman the Frenchman became an 
architect and challenged by the euphoria of the kind of French 
economy and French miracle of rebuilding he speculated that it 
was unbelievably exciting to live on inclined space and that 
anyone who always spent his life on a horizontal plane was 
wasting a permanent sense of adventure the other men the same 
age the same history also an architect was surrounded by a huge 
amount of veterans in wheelchairs his friends who came out of 
the war wounded and he became dedicated to the issue of 
handicapped access and therefore was single-handedly responsible 
for making those conditions accepted in America and and now 
universally applied in the entire world so one had a huge 
influence but the influence was on kind of lowering the steepness 
and therefore lowering difficulty lowering discomfort the other 
was in any technical term of the word a failure but in my eyes a 
totally heroic failure because he wanted the impossible and I 
think that that is also kind of streak that is hidden in this 
whole discussion are you insane if you want the impossible or 
are you only kind of responsible if you want to explore the 
maximum of what what what is possible are you utopian or not 
do you think it's important to be utopian and then what is your 
utopia

Tony_Fadell: (42:13) I think it's important to be optimistic I 
don't think there's a utopia because everyone has a different 
way of thinking of the right way to live and the right way to 
be so no I'm not a technoutopian by any means but I do believe 
we have societal or in global problems that we all need to 
chip in to fix we can't all decide  with the lack of information 
to coliving our lives without understanding each of our own 
footprint on this planet and by having that information you're 
able to actually adjust things and just alone in the in the 
number of homes were in we've already saved over two billion 
kilowatt hours of energy in just two years in just two and a 
half years that's the entire energy consumption of the US in 30 
minutes we shut that off and that was just little things that no 
one's done anything really differently accept the product learned 
from your behavior and it just reflected what you do and you 
didn't have to program it so I think these little things you 
can take it to the extreme absolutely and the government can 
come and say we're gonna control everything we think that these 
little things little steps each one we can do can actually help 
a lot

Niklas_Maak: (43:21) so so Rem what would be your utopia in the 
age of learning dwelling devices

Rem_Koolhaas: (43:29) I I really cannot answer this question 
I just want to we had breakfast this morning and I want to 
kind of refer to to your what you told us about your youth and 
and how you were you know your grandfather was involved in the 
car industry and so how from a very young age you work kind of 
actually making things and kind of making elements and and 
what I understood from there is that if we had known each other 
at that time it would have been wonderful to collaborate because 
you could collaborate actually on an element now it is wonderful 
to collaborate but what you do is you plant a device in my 
element and there is therefore less of a kind of less of an 
overlapping and less of so I would love to kind of work with 
you as an engineer on the kind of tooling and kind of maybe 
taking a step back and increasing not the intelligence of a 
single element but the intelligence of the whole

Tony_Fadell: (44:35) yeah I I thank you and that's why we're 
here that's why I'm here is to learn actually from from from 
architects and this audience and to learn about different parts 
of the world and how technology can be intelligently applied to 
solving these basic problems that we have not utopia where one 
button does everything for you the Jetson style we're talking 
about simple basic things unloved products that we've had in 
our homes you if you look at many of the elements that we have 
in our homes today they came from industrial settings from 
commercial settings and they got refactored and put into our 
hands it's kind of like what happened with Microsoft Windows 
and and technology it came from the ID IT departments of of 
of you know big companies and it got pushed down upon you and 
you had to basically take it the way it was we had to take 
commercial technology and it became consumer what we're doing 
now is really truly making consumer products and and personal 
products for people and now we're actually going back into the 
large office spaces and the government's and changing those 
products the

Niklas_Maak: (45:42) so this means you you're taking your 
technology from the level of housing to the level of urbanism 
which is quite interesting we you you are like getting bigger 
and bigger by now kind of planning whole cities with your 
technology so Rem what do you see you you worked among other 
countries in China where you said you could address certain 
projects not with architectural means anymore but more with 
urbanistic tools so could you maybe before we open this up to 
the public could we talk if we talk about architecture and 
technology talk also about the impact of technology in urbanism 
and planning devices for these big tasks of the future to come

Rem_Koolhaas: (46:22) Well the interesting thing is that this 
communication is not the the only communication with Silicon 
Valley that we've had for some reason in the last year there has 
been a lot of interaction and interface with Silicon Valley 
and us and I really welcome the first appearance of anyone from 
Silicon Valley in Venice because I think it's a very very 
interesting world situation and I hope that you also understand 
that we need you and your kinds of thinking in in every sense 
so you should feel not a kind of way of skepticism but on the 
contrary a profound need and profound welcome to to collaborate 
the only and and so we've been confronted with organizations that 
undeniably can help plan cities with vastly greater intelligence 
and that can kind of undeniably help to anticipate a number of 
likely scenarios that are imposed on us for instance by global 
warming it's without any doubt that cities like Venice which is 
kind of sinking in front of our very eyes and kind of the the 
absolute example of how threatening this kind of reality is is 
that with that in front of our eyes we cannot be we cannot afford 
to be cynical about what all of this has to offer on the other 
hand probably a city like Venice could not have ever been produced 
if we had these technologies because it is so profoundly irrational 
and so profoundly illogical to of all places work here and that 
is for me a constant dilemma yes we can be infinitely better 
behaved we can be infinitely more logical we can be infinitely 
more correct we can be infinitely better prepared we can be 
infinitely but I have not seen yet and that could be the possible 
outcome of a kind of interaction I have not seen yet the the 
profoundly creative dimension that could really transform beyond 
improvement

Niklas_Maak: (48:52) yeah

Rem_Koolhaas: (48:53) or that could really transform but of course 
we are all very keen to engage that possibility

Niklas_Maak: (48:58) yeah thank you
