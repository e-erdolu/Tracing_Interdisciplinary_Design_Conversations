Paul_Goldberger: (00:14) 
great thank you welcome to what I think 
is the only panel at this summit that 
brings together the brick-and-mortar 
physical world that we all live in and 
the tech and information worlds that we 
mainly talk about so what I hope we can 
do in the next few minutes is look a 
little bit at where they intersect or 
where they don't where they should 
connect more or whether maybe they 
should connect less which i think is 
part of the point of the provocative and 
remarkable exhibition Rem Koolhaas did 
at the Venice Biennale this year which 
is still on if anyone's going to Venice 
called the Elements of Architecture 
which looked at very very basic things 
in architecture to try to I think 
reinforce a sense of physicality again 
we have a very short video really that 
just gives you a very fast overview of 
it maybe we'll show it now and then 
we'll begin conversation

Paul_Goldberger: (02:12) 
okay we now now it's time for you to finish the sentence

Rem_Koolhaas: (02:17) 
basically what I was trying to do 
is to to address the issue that 
architecture but also city planning and 
also the making of cars is kind of 
really about to change fundamentally to 
the kind of intersection with the 
digital world and that process is taking 
place under the influence of a lot of 
the thinking here but it's taking place 
alone and and not in combination or not 
in collaboration with the domains that 
you influence and so I wanted to kind of really 
show that for instance the notion of the 
fireplace is deeply influenced by what 
Tony has done in Nest but that the condition 
of the floor is changing that the 
ceiling is changing and I wanted to kind 
of really create a situation that 
instead of surrendering blankly to these 
kind of forces we can actually begin to 
collaborate and in the collaboration 
perhaps also question some of the 
directions that are being generated

Paul_Goldberger: (03:26) 
Tony Fadell who founded Nest 
is I think one of the great I will say 
creators because I pledged not to use 
the word innovators one more time today 
one of the great creators in Silicon 
Valley I know you guys have talked 
before because you spent you actually 
in Venice did a long a long conversation 
which was somewhat oppositional today 
Rem you're talking about collaboration 
what what has changed

Rem_Koolhaas: (04:02) I I

Paul_Goldberger: (04:03) 
other than the fact that you're in the turf of tech

Rem_Koolhaas: (04:06) 
no no no actually actually it was always about collaboration

Paul_Goldberger: (04:09) okay 

Rem_Koolhaas: (04:10) 
so there's no there's no opposition 
I think it's it's interesting how basically 
in each profession there is a position embedded 
whether you want to or not

Paul_Goldberger: (04:20) right

Rem_Koolhaas: (04:21) 
and this is what I was saying 
you know if you're an architect you by 
definition have to care about legacy you 
have to care by definition about the 
past and about history and that doesn't 
mean you're a technophobe I think that 
all those things can be can happen in 
close collaboration but the 
collaboration without collaboration I 
think that you risk going in a kind of 
tangent without let's say the the interaction 
or the interface with some parts of the 
real world and we risk simply being left behind

Tony_Fadell: (05:01) exactly

Paul_Goldberger: (05:02) Tony yeah

Tony_Fadell: (05:03) 
when we look at when we 
look at technology today being brought 
in it's really retrofitted into buildings 

Paul_Goldberger: (05:08) right

Tony_Fadell: (05:09) 
it's we're not designing buildings around it 
or with it it really involved you know now we do 
it when we brought in electricity it was always 
tacked on back in the late eighteen hundreds right

Paul_Goldberger: (05:17) right right well or

Tony_Fadell: (05:18) and now it's integrated into the walls

Paul_Goldberger: (05:19) 
or even or even inside plumbing

Tony_Fadell: (05:21) 
yeah plumbing and all those things 
were integrated over time we're now at 
that next phase where we're taking these 
other things such as what we're building 
at Nest or other companies and now 
starting to think and collaborating to 
really make it part of the architecture 
so the computing is not in-your-face and 
these kinds of sensors are not 
in-your-face they actually recede into the 
structure itself and make the structure 
better not just be this tacked on

Paul_Goldberger: (05:43) 
so you think the the Nest is really a sort of 
intermediate generation

Tony_Fadell: (05:48) 
well I I hope so 
I hope there's going to be a lot more 
evolution when I look at you know the 
arcane way of somehow these different 
systems work together they're really not 
modernized at all it's because no one 
really thought about these two worlds 
colliding and so what's really been for 
us is is now talking to architects and 
talking to system designers and and 
plumbing and equipment manufacturers and 
and they're learning about our world and 
they have lots of questions just like we 
had in Venice there's a lot of questions 
that we have to answer on both sides to 
be able to learn about each other to be 
able to make these integrations happen 
but it's going to take a long time

Paul_Goldberger: (06:22) 
ok if I were to take your comment about 
collaboration literally and say okay you 
know I'm building a new building and I 
want to commission the firm of Koolhaas 
and Fadell to design it what would 
it look like where would we be going 
with it how would it be different from 
the buildings we know

Rem_Koolhaas: (06:43) 
I I think the beauty 
of what he is doing or what they are 
doing is is that it's not necessarily 
defining a new look but it's kind of 
defining a new performance and therefore 
it simply adds another layer of 
intelligence and to the extent I think 
that oppositional is the wrong way but 
word but yes I'm critical of certain 
aspects I'm critical of the kind of 
relentless profit motive that kind of seems 
to invade or characterize almost every 
one of the new inventions and therefore 
kind of suddenly introducing an architecture a 
domain or a question that never was 
there before and and and that is really the the 
the one area where I'm critical I'm also critical 
in the sense of the arguments I think more maybe 
the two are connected maybe it is 
because the profit motive is 
so important more and more inventions 
are sold because they support security 
increased security they increase comfort 
and they increase sustainability and

Paul_Goldberger: (08:00) 
that was your new Trinity you said an essay you wrote yes

Rem_Koolhaas: (08:03) 
and I was basically saying you know my generation was 
interested in the notion of egalite fraternite and the 
French Revolution and now we are stuck with comfort 
sustainability and security and I'm not necessarily 
finding that a kind of great change

Paul_Goldberger: (08:22) 
well is that really less an 
architectural change than a change in 
the the social mores of the time

Rem_Koolhaas: (08:31) clearly yeah

Paul_Goldberger: (08:32) 
that we move from a sense of the common good to 
a sense of the private good

Rem_Koolhaas: (08:36) yeah clearly

Paul_Goldberger: (08:37) 
and architecture inevitably reflects a 
society's values more than it actually 
shapes them I think for is it for better or 
for worse it it seems to Tony

Tony_Fadell: (08:48) 
well I I I think that you 
know if we look at what's going on in 
homes today obviously it's about the 
home first but if you can actually get 
people engaged with some of these new 
systems getting engaged and learn about 
their homes to the until today a lot of 
people come to us and say well yeah I 
feel like I have to always take care of 
my home why do I always have to take 
care of it there's a leak here this is 
needs to get fixed why can't that the 
systems tell me before things fail so 
that I can we can be proactive about it as 
opposed to it's broken and now we don't 
have hot water at two in the morning or 
something like that so we're looking at 
also bringing freedom back into the home 
for homeowners so I think there's a 
there's a gentle balance here but it it 
does start really selfishly by the 
homeowner and the people who live in it 
but hopefully with information in these 
kinds of systems they can learn about 
the community around them and be able to 
do have the larger impact through the 
the the information we can provide through 
these systems

Paul_Goldberger: (09:41) 
so it really is about the physical 
systems within a structure they would I 
mean Nest certainly is that

Tony_Fadell: (09:46) 
well our goal is really to take the things 
that are already around us that have been unloved 
for years and and literally reinvent 
them so they give you that information 
and make you part of the community so we 
have a a a rolling total of all the energy 
that was saved by all of our customers 
and it's been two and a half billion 
kilowatt hours already in just less than 
three years and so people start to see 
and they can see why they've used more or 
used less and then they can start to make 
conscious choices we're not trying to 
we're not trying to be judgmental saying you 
have to turn it down we're just giving 
them the information just like the 
quantified self we're doing the 
quantified home in a way to allow people 
to make better choices if they so choose

Paul_Goldberger: (10:21) 
I like my Nest just because it looks so beautiful

Tony_Fadell: (10:24) 
and there's another reason for it as well

Paul_Goldberger: (10:25) 
I I I don't really I mean it's great if it 
saves energy although that's not why I 
have it I have it because the the that 
old Honeywell thermostat was one of the 
ugliest things I'd ever seen actually so 
if let's talk about technology in a 
different part of the building process 
why is the process of actually making 
buildings so slow you know that you can 
have what we can envision the most wired 
house the house with nests up the wazoo 
the house that with every other tech 
thing we're capable of creating today it 
still probably took two years to build 
why has technology not made inroads into 
the way in which the thing itself the 
architecture itself is made

Tony_Fadell: (11:15) 
well from what I've experienced by building homes was really

Paul_Goldberger: (11:20) 
yeah you can speak you can speak as a client now if you want

Tony_Fadell: (11:23) 
Yeah I want to I wanted to do a prefab house I 
want to do a prefab I want to do it 
exactly the way we wanted it it was going to 
come off of a manufacturing line but 
then what happened was we wanted to make 
a few changes it wasn't going to be the 
exact house we wanted and the reason why 
we couldn't make the changes was because 
the building codes in every single 
jurisdiction around the US are 
different and we fight that every day 
with Nest there's all these little 
arcane rules for us to be able to sell 
our products into each thing that that 
whole governmental 
you know legislation goes around and 
stifles the innovation for architects 
for manufacturers to do prefab homes or 
even the systems inside of homes and 
then you have the whole contractor 
organization who wants to just do what 
they've always been doing because they 
don't want to learn about new a lot of 
them don't want to learn about new 
things so all of these things come 
together to really stifle innovation at 
least I've seen it from a customer 
perspective

Rem_Koolhaas: (12:17) 
my my answer would be 
different I think that the architecture 
is both ancient and slightly absurd 
because what we do we we design prototypes 
we design prototypes for things that 
will never go into production and we 
therefore design a chain or sequence of 
completely unique buildings completely 
unique definitions that are addressing 
unique context unique programs unique 
people so we are in the business of 
creating uniqueness and that is of 
course very beautiful because almost 
everything else seems to be kind of on 
the way to be normative repetitive etcetera etcetera 
but basically if you do a prototype you 
have to be careful you have to test 
things and that's why it takes long

Paul_Goldberger: (13:02) 
architecture is in its very essence 
sort of bespoke we could say

Rem_Koolhaas: (13:07) 
yeah I I would say so yeah

Tony_Fadell: (13:08) 
it for our from the technical rule we say it's always in beta

Paul_Goldberger: (13:11) 
yeah it's always in

Tony_Fadell: (13:12) 
it's always in beta it never finally shapes

Rem_Koolhaas: (13:14) yeah yeah

Tony_Fadell: (13:15) it's a live live piece

Paul_Goldberger: (13:16) 
but if it remains that way how will we 
ever solve any of the problems that we 
we would like architecture to solve even 
as it also creates extraordinary 
aesthetic experiences and profound 
spaces for us we also want to house more 
people we want to make day-to-day life 
more pleasurable for more people with 
better roofs over their heads or even 
some roof over their heads how is this 
compatible with that 

Rem_Koolhaas: (13:48) 
I think that you're you're confusing political  
issues or economic issues with architectural 
issues I think there are parts of the world 
where architecture really provides an 
amazing service to unbelievable amounts 
of human beings ironically maybe you 
don't live in one of those parts of the 
world neither do I and that is why of 
course major and important architectural 
initiatives are taking place now in Asia in

Paul_Goldberger: (14:20) right

Rem_Koolhaas: (14:21) 
in the countries that that we are remote 
from and that is why I personally have 
been making every effort to be involved 
in those countries whatever ideological kind 
of issue one might have with it but I think it's 
unfair to say that architecture is so 
slow that cannot accommodate speed 
because for instance in China it is 
accommodating amazing speed

Paul_Goldberger: (14:49) 
you were one of the very first people to become 
engaged with the question of the 
megacity as I recall and and its 
implications around the world which you 
did ten or more years ago

Rem_Koolhaas: (15:00) ten

Paul_Goldberger: (15:01) twenty

Rem_Koolhaas: (15:02) 
fifty no I I came I came to New York in the seventies 
to to understand kind of really really what 
a megacity was and to understand how 
different the megacity was from what we 
collectively were still cherishing as 
the model of the city ie something well 
composed coherent with beautiful 
dimensions and and proportions and an 
overview I think that we have any merit it 
is that I was able to describe something 
much wilder much more chaotic much more 
kind of random and arbitrary still as a kind 
of defensible and interesting organism 
and an interesting support for culture

Paul_Goldberger: (15:55) 
well Delirious New York is I I what you're 
referring to I think which is your book 
that is really now a classic and was forty 
years ago I think but

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:07) I was joking

Paul_Goldberger: (16:08) 
no but it was it was pretty close but it was it was almost 
wasn't it wasn't it the late seventies that came out

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:12) yeah yeah

Paul_Goldberger: (16:13) 
so it was almost forty years ago 
were you in effect saying that the 
New York was the first metacity you know

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:24) not

Paul_Goldberger: (16:25) megacity

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:26) 
not really but I simply took New York and and because 
it was convenient it's limited it it's defined and 
and and used it as a kind of prototype of a 
condition that I was anticipating would 
work would be more and more ubiquitous

Paul_Goldberger: (16:43) 
because the the scale of the megacities 
around the world now makes New York look 
like San Francisco

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:49) yeah yeah

Tony_Fadell: (16:50) yeah absolutely

Paul_Goldberger: (16:51) it would seem

Tony_Fadell: (16:52) 
absolutely Rem do you do you see any real differences 
in in in your projects when they're in China versus 
India or or some of the other things you do

Rem_Koolhaas: (16:58) yeah I

Tony_Fadell: (17:00) 
interactions with the government or something

Rem_Koolhaas: (17:02) 
I I think the the my my final conclusion and it's kind of 
really surprised me myself is that the 
most important kind of difference in 
architecture today is the age of people 
that decide basically in in China the 
decision maker is thirtyfive in Europe the 
decision maker is kind of fiftyfive in America 
the decision maker in many cases is a 
trustee and therefore kind of even even 
older and I think that age is kind of really a 
clearly correlation between age and 
appetite for risk and so for me the the 
ultimate difference is what adventure what 
amount of adventure what about amount 
which amount of change our particular 
society is willing to engage with yeah

Tony_Fadell: (18:02) absolutely absolutely

Paul_Goldberger: (18:03) 
so do you think the old city that we were 
talking about that you wrote about in 
Delirious New York that the the the coherent 
well the coherent city that you referred 
to before is is merely a sentimental

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:17) no

Paul_Goldberger: (18:18) attraction at this point

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:19) no

Paul_Goldberger: (18:20) no okay

Rem_Koolhaas: (18:21) 
I I think that I'm European and 
therefore I of course I love European 
cities but I became aware early that 
there is a kind of implied considerable 
shift going on and and we've seen it whether 
you call it globalization or 
mobilization or the awakening of China or 
the kind of shift of economic activity 
in the world and that we had never 
adjusted our paradigms and that 
therefore we were still looking at what 
was being produced in those other 
territories by those other cultures under 
those different circumstances and 
still we were cherishing this kind of 
one model that nobody else could could 
ever achieve so we had a kind of very 
bizarre relationship with with the world 
because we could all only say well it's 
not like us and it's not as beautiful as 
we were and therefore I try to simply to 
to kind of readjust that that kind of situation

Paul_Goldberger: (19:25) 
and so so by one model you mean the traditional Western

Rem_Koolhaas: (19:29) Western Western model yeah

Paul_Goldberger: (19:30) 
street oriented city that that the the sort of Jane Jacobs 
model we might almost say of the lively street

Rem_Koolhaas: (19:37) 
as an American you could say Jane Jacobs or you 
could also say Haussmann or or anybody

Paul_Goldberger: (19:44) right okay

Rem_Koolhaas: (19:45) 
and in Venice one of the things that was for me 
very very important is to look at 
elements also of other cultures and and 
therefore we have a kind of analysis for 
instance how the Chinese designed 
roofs in the eleventh century according to 
which formula and initially we thought 
that meant Chinese are not kind of 
original but as we translated the kind of 
literature more more we discovered that 
actually they were dealing with 
incredibly modern phenomena like 
corruption kind of value engineering 
etcetera and that kind of basically embedded 
in that kind of thinking about how 
elements should be constructed there was 
a vast intelligence very often even if 
it's thousand years still of important 
relevance and what I'm kind of actually 
interested in seeing is whether there is 
a kind of combination of combining digital 
intelligence with all those other forms 
of intelligence or whether it means that 
you basically throw out kind of 
everything as antiquated or or ancient

Paul_Goldberger: (21:02) 
yeah I I I felt that elements could be 
read almost both ways as both a valedictory a 
farewell to traditional architectural elements and 
also at the same time a plea that is somehow 
connected to this world

Tony_Fadell: (21:18) 
well if you looked at elements there were different 
strands along the way that died off right

Paul_Goldberger: (21:22) yeah

Rem_Koolhaas: (21:23) yeah

Tony_Fadell: (21:24) 
there were certain things that continued and 
other things that died off it was just it was 
interesting to watch the evolution or things 
turned into other elements

Rem_Koolhaas: (21:29) yeah

Tony_Fadell: (21:30) and so for me

Paul_Goldberger: (21:31) right

Tony_Fadell: (21:32) we're at one one point in time

Rem_Koolhaas: (21:33) yeah

Tony_Fadell: (21:34) 
what is it going to look like in twenty or thirty 
years I'm I'm I'm fascinated to see what the 
collaboration looks like

Paul_Goldberger: (21:38) 
and you know the history of 
architecture has really always been a 
history of aesthetics being enabled by 
technology right I mean from the flying 
buttress of the Gothic cathedral and 
then when it's superseded it's gone I 
mean nobody does flying buttresses anymore 
right so all the way through architectural 
history it's been technology the latest 
technology enabling some new aesthetic 
direction

Tony_Fadell: (22:05) 
exactly risk you know risk takers risk taking clients 
and architects working together with the technologists 
putting things together something stick right the CCTV 
building right that's an absolutely gorgeous

Paul_Goldberger: (22:15) 
CCTV CCTV in Beijing which I'm sorry I wish we had 
an image of could not have been built twenty 
years ago is that right or could it have 
been

Rem_Koolhaas: (22:25) 
no but but the reason is not 
technology per se but it's the fact that 
the construction and the details of the 
construction could only be calculated in 
time by current computers

Paul_Goldberger: (22:42) right

Rem_Koolhaas: (22:43) 
simply computers only ten twelve years ago 
would have been too slow to in time 
calculate all the effects all the kind 
of moments all the conditions inside that building

Paul_Goldberger: (22:54) 
well even before that I mean it was in the nineties that 
Frank Gehry said that without that computer digital 
software Bilbao could never have been 
built this is you're saying one 
generation almost later the same issue 
applies but that confirms that at least 
sometimes architecture is at the cutting 
edge of technology even if it takes 
forever to build a conventional house

Tony_Fadell: (23:21) 
but we put more and more technology and 
you know I look at it from when we 
design a product there's still a 
twelve month kind of window when we start a 
project to finish and we'll put more and 
more technology in it every year but 
it's still really that that that human 
design process that needs to happen to 
to to have a great outcome and I think that's 
just what it takes because you have to 
iterate even though we say it's a beta 
product you know in terms of architecture 
you still must iterate and iterate 
to get to that point to keep it within 
the two year kind of thing and work with 
all the governmental bodies and all the 
new energy renewable policies and those 
kinds of things so it's it's interesting

Paul_Goldberger: (23:58) 
what tell me more for a minute about and 
we're almost at time for questions so any if 
anyone has any this is the moment to 
head toward the mics but while we wait 
for that let me go back to the whole 
question of of of the ultimate digital house 
you guys collaborating on a new kind of 
architecture how different would the 
rooms be how different would what what 
would be different in my living room if 
I had this house

Tony_Fadell: (24:25) 
well when we design our products

Paul_Goldberger: (24:27) ok

Tony_Fadell: (24:28) 
I I I you know people come to me 
why didn't you even put a screen on it why didn't you 
even put why didn't you even have a device 
in the home why don't just do everything 
from the phone and I'm like wait a 
second you have guests in your house you 
have children in your house you have you 
know elderly in your house they're not 
always going to have a phone with them 
at all times and maybe it's not even 
charged you still need physical elements 
in the home they could look slightly 
different there's got to be a a a standard 
interface for these things you just 
don't throw everything out so you have 
to be able to blend you know that's been 
part of my career is 
blending the old with the new and to 
allow people to move forward with it 
not not feeling trepidation 
that they're going to a whole new world 
and throwing everything out don't 
understand anything longer so I think 
there's going to be a blend in this 
collaboration and I hope it's going to 
hide the technology not to show it the 
way it is today you know in many ways 
but you'll still have interface physical interface

Paul_Goldberger: (25:21) 
will you have a whole different system of of transmitting 
electrical power say

Rem_Koolhaas: (25:26) essentially essentially yes

Tony_Fadell: (25:27) 
well we know that there are much better ways of doing 
electricity than a hundred and ten volts or 
two hundred forty volts fifty hertz sixty hertz 
they're much better ways high voltage ways for high 
current for low current that you know you can't 
get shocked on you can have better 
energy efficiency DC powers really great 
there's many technologies but because we 
have so much infrastructure built around 
the appliances the the wiring systems 
the contractors everything that it's 
hard to be able to adopt these things 
unless you go to an island or a to a 
yacht or some new city that someone's 
willing to invest and bring all that 
technology in

Paul_Goldberger: (25:58) is that happening anywhere

Tony_Fadell: (26:01) 
I know in labs it's happening I don't know 
if it's happening in the real world

Rem_Koolhaas: (26:05) 
I think that in one of the rooms in 
Venice is is interesting because on one 
wall you see two hundred Victorian windows that 
are unbelievably intricate beautiful 
delicate decorated intelligent and 
enabling a vast amount of different 
manipulations and on the the other part 
of the room you see a typical 
contemporary aluminum window being 
tested to conform to the European norm 
basically what you see is in kind of 
just over a hundred years an 
unbelievable loss in terms of ingenuity 
variation beauty presumably but I hope 
will be one of the effects of digital 
technology is not that it kind of 
reduces kind of possibility but it actually 
kind of expands possibility and and that 
we can find a way to increase choice 
again in in certain ways I mean that's 
that should be a kind of pact

Tony_Fadell: (27:09) absolutely

Paul_Goldberger: (27:10) 
the idea of greater choice

Rem_Koolhaas: (27:11) 
not a greater choice in the obvious way but greater 
investment in in in creativity and in alternatives 
I would say

Paul_Goldberger: (27:24) 
Rem and in your introduction to the 
elements in Venice 
you wrote I thought very movingly 
actually about recalling 
architectural elements from your 
childhood from the apartment you grew up 
in the balcony the image of the balcony 
I remember particularly strongly is it 
possible that if we begin to forfeit 
certain kinds of physical elements in 
favor of digital ones we could lose that 
sort of resonance in your memory that 
degree of profound influence that that 
architecture can have on your psyche

Rem_Koolhaas: (28:02) 
I you you make it sound kind of 
slightly more conservative than than 
I meant it and I think I was simply 
inventorizing all my first memories of these 
elements and I think that kids whatever 
happens they've always have first 
memories whether it is over TV over TV 
or a toaster of so I don't think that 
will fundamentally change it's not that 
I'm kind of worried that kind of somehow 
what people are doing here will kind of 
flatten the world I'm I'm kind of simply 
world worried that there is a focus on 
issues that in the end will kind of reduce 
our options reduce our appetite for 
adventure reduce our appetite for I 
mentioned it in Venice transgression

Tony_Fadell: (28:55) transgression

Paul_Goldberger: (28:56) 
transgression right ok 
I mean in in other words is it possible 
that your house would know too much 
we've talked a lot today in the last 
couple days about other

Tony_Fadell: (29:05) yeah and

Paul_Goldberger: (29:06) in other panels

Tony_Fadell: (29:07) Rem said this in Venice is

Paul_Goldberger: (29:08) right

Tony_Fadell: (29:09) 
like literally all these systems are going to be 
talking to you telling you what to do every day 
and so you're going to conform to what that house 
is telling you to do because it was programmed 
from some Big Brother somewhere and I hope 
that's definitely not the case what we want to 
do is give people much more freedom much 
more choice but give them the information to 
make those choices

Rem_Koolhaas: (29:26) 
but it it could happen of course

Paul_Goldberger: (29:28) yes

Tony_Fadell: (29:29) it could happen absolutely

Paul_Goldberger: (29:30) 
right right just 
because inevitably even if there's not a 
Big Brother situation you you do respond 
to what the device allows you to 
encourage you to do in very subtle ways right

Tony_Fadell: (29:44) 
but that's what you have today those devices they 
might be dumb but they're very limited 
as well you can only do certain things with them

Paul_Goldberger: (29:49) sure

Tony_Fadell: (29:50) 
what we're seeing is much 
more creativity much more flexible use 
of these things from wherever it is the 
question is is what is the feedback to 
you and what is it asking you to do

Paul_Goldberger: (29:58) right right

Rem_Koolhaas: (29:59) 
yeah but let's take a very stupid example 
there are cars now that basically 
project speed that you drive with in front 
of you unfortunately I have to admit 
that I behave better with that kind of machine 
than without it but that's why I hate 
both the machine and myself for being 
such a conformist and so I think that 
there are embedded in a lot of our stuff 
is the same you know pressure to conform 
and I think that is for me cumulatively 
a very oppressive situation

Paul_Goldberger: (30:38) 
you told me earlier today that you just driven a 
BMW i8 what did you think of it as a 
piece of design

Rem_Koolhaas: (30:45) 
no I I was part of a jury

Paul_Goldberger: (30:47) oh ok

Rem_Koolhaas: (30:48) 
that had to define the best car of the year for 
Germany and it was in a way eye-opening because 
clearly the car industry is also engaging with the 
Internet and and therefore also going 
through the same radical transformation 
and and being on the cusp you know are 
we producing kind of guided robots or are we 
improving the the machine that that we 
are familiar with and and so it's kind of 
very tragic because on the one hand you have 
the most unbelievable fantastic 
incredible sense of adventure behind 
some of the steering wheels of sport 
cars that I cannot mention here but that 
really are deeply thrilling every second 
you drive them

Tony_Fadell: (31:40) 
and they're also a blend of technology and the 
and your world and bringing efficiency in as well

Rem_Koolhaas: (31:44) 
and on the other hand quasi robotic hideous 
capsules that that that that probably 
will deliver on their promise to deliver 
you to the destination safely and so my 
heart is clearly you know on one side 
but I I hope that as we move on in 
this confrontation or in this kind of 
intersection of the two worlds we we don't 
have to face these dilemmas between kind 
of danger and harmlessness but that we 
can kind of define more profound terms

Paul_Goldberger: (32:23) right

Rem_Koolhaas: (32:24) 
for our existential demands

Paul_Goldberger: (32:28) 
and actually the the car industry is a very good 
example because it at its best it does not sacrifice 
the things that that make your heart race faster

Tony_Fadell: (32:36) 
sure absolutely but there's a lot of times 
when you're sitting in traffic and your heart racing 
very fast and you just wish I could just do something else

Paul_Goldberger: (32:42) right right right yeah right right right

Tony_Fadell: (32:43) 
so you know I think we all love you know we 
all love that feeling of freedom when you're 
driving a car but ninety seven percent of the 
time you really just know like I gotta get 
there and I'd rather be doing something 
else than sitting in this traffic

Paul_Goldberger: (32:55) 
like like being at home in your house playing 
with your your technology

Tony_Fadell: (32:58) something something

Paul_Goldberger: (32:59) 
something okay good good okay please join me in 
thanking Tony Fadell and Rem Koolhaas

Tony_Fadell: (33:05) thank you

Paul_Goldberger: (33:06) great thank you
