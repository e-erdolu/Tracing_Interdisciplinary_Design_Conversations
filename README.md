## Abstract
With the increasing convergence of computational and architectural practices, a common interdisciplinary encounter of today is between architects and tech designers. Tech companies, startups, designers, and entrepreneurs are increasingly interested in homes, offices, infrastructures, and cities as sites of deployment; and architecture offices, architects, and architectural researchers engage with software, sensors, robots, and other devices as their instruments. The mutual interest in each other's work and artifacts start to bring these two figures more often in conversations, debates, or collaborations within labs or projects. Because of different knowledge backgrounds and discourses, these conversations can at times involve low levels of engagement as well as exchanges and gaps. Producing insights on engagement, exchanges, and gaps between the disciplinary discourses of architects and tech designers is a crucial first step towards understanding the qualities of interaction between the two groups. This paper reports on a case study of two interdisciplinary conversations, each between two architects and a tech designer. In analyzing the first conversation, we investigated the engagement, exchanges, and gaps between these actorsâ€™ disciplinary discourses by text processing and visualization. By analyzing the second conversation, we conducted a comparative analysis of insights. By using text processing and visualization, we also explored the potential of these methods in understanding the conversational dynamics investigated. The case study and visualizations revealed that, even though the architects and the tech designer engage through a sharing and exchange across their discourses, there are issues in the qualities of that sharing and exchange. The paper finally outlines these issues.
